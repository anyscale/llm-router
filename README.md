# Building an LLM Router for High-Quality and Cost-Effective Responses

When developing applications using Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving high-quality responses while maintaining a budget is a key challenge. Closed models like GPT-4 provide superior quality but are costly, especially with a high volume of queries. Conversely, Open Source Software (OSS) models are more economical but may not match the quality, especially for complex or domain-specific queries.

An **LLM Router** helps balance these aspects by deciding which queries are routed to a closed LLM and which to an OSS LLM based on the query's complexity or domain specificity. Below is a schematic representation of an LLM Router:

</div>

Given a set of user queries, an LLM router enables generating high-quality LLM responses while minimizing the overall cost.

# Approach

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to train an LLM router on the Anyscale platform. We make the following design choices:

1. **Model Choices**: We’ll use GPT-4 as an example of a closed LLM and Mixtral-8x7B as the OSS LLM, so our llm router will route between these two models.
2. **Response Quality Rating**: We'll quantify the quality of an LLM response on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with higher scores indicating better quality. For simplicity, we'll assume that GPT-4 always achieves a 5-star rating, so it serves as a reference for Mixtral-8x7B.
3. **LLM Router Model**: We'll finetune a Llama3-8B model as our LLM router and leverage Anyscale's powerful API. Our research (see our [arXiv paper](put link to arxiv paper)) shows that this model offers superior routing performance compared to smaller architectures.

More concretely, the objective of an LLM router is to direct "simple" queries to Mixtral-8x7B, thereby maintaining high overall response quality (e.g., an average score of 4.8/5) while significantly reducing costs (e.g., by 50%).

We show that it's possible to build LLM routers that achieve outstanding performance. Below are the results from two of our best-performing LLM routers: the Causal LLM, which we'll develop in detail below, and a Matrix Factorization (MF) model, both evaluated on the MT Bench benchmark ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05685)). These models are compared against two public LLM routing systems from Unify AI and NotDiamond. For more details on this result and additional ones, refer to our paper.

Below we discuss steps that enable anyone to build a strong LLM router, starting with data labeling, model training and evaluation.

### Setup


```python
# Install required packages
!pip install -r requirements.txt

# Store your ANYSCALE_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY in /home/ray/default/.env
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv("/home/ray/default/.env")

```


# Step 1: Prepare Labeled Data <a id="generate-labeled-data"></a>

Our llm router essentially functions as a binary classifier, deciding whether to route a query to GPT-4 or Mixtral-8x7B based on the query text. Initially, we considered labeled data in the format `(query, routing_label)`, where `routing_label` is 1 if the query should be routed to Mixtral-8x7B and 0 if it should be routed to GPT-4.

However, our early experiments revealed that *binary labels do not provide sufficient signal for training a robust router model*. Therefore, we adopted a different labeling approach using a *1-5 scoring system*, which reflects how well Mixtral-8x7B can effectively respond to the user's query. More specifically:

- **4-5**: Mixtral-8x7B produces a very strong answer, showing deep understanding, creativity, detailed insight, and high relevance.
- **3**: Mixtral-8x7B provides an adequate answer with moderate detail, relevance, and factual accuracy.
- **1-2**: Mixtral-8x7B struggles to produce a strong answer due to the question's difficulty, vagueness, or the model's limitations.

We use labeled samples in the format `(query, score_label)`. The `routing_label` can be derived from the `score_label` by setting a score threshold for quality, i.e. `routing_label = 1 if score_label >= 4 else 0`.

we'll dive into the detailed process of preparing our labeled dataset.


## 1.1: Query Dataset

We want our router to be effective in open-ended chat domains. So, our first step is to collect a set of generic queries from the [Nectar dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/berkeley-nest/Nectar). We chose the Nectar dataset for two reasons: it combines queries from many different domains, including open-ended chat, and it has responses from many models, including over 191K responses from GPT-4.


```python
from src.utils import load_and_display_nectar

nectar_df = load_and_display_nectar()
```


<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>prompt</th>
      <th>answers</th>
      <th>turns</th>
      <th>source</th>
      <th>good_natured</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>0</th>
        <td>\n\nHuman: 0.002 = 1000 \n1 = x?\n\nAssistant:</td>
        <td>
            [<br>{'answer': 'To find the value of x, we can set up a proportion using the given information:
0.002/1000 = 1/x
  ...  x = 500,000', 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'rank': 3.0},<br><br>
{'answer': 'If 0.002 equals 1000, then 1 would equal 500,000.', 'model': 'gpt-4', 'rank': 4.0},<br><br>

{'answer': 'It seems like you are asking for the value of x in the equation x = 1/0.002. 
To solve this equation, you can divide both sides by 0.002 to get:

Therefore, x = 500.', 'model': 'mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1', 'rank': 7.0}<br>]</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>[sharegpt]</td>
        <td>True</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>




    Number of queries with GPT-4 responses: 191487


## 1.2 Data Preprocessing

We will use a subset of the Nectar data that includes responses from GPT-4, as these will be used to generate scores (as shown below). We will process this data by focusing on single-turn conversations, filtering for good-natured interactions, and cleaning up the prompts and responses to maintain high quality. Additionally, we will sample a small subset from the dataset for the purpose of this tutorial; however, you can skip sampling to work with the full dataset.


```python
from src.utils import preprocess_nectar

nectar_gpt4_df = preprocess_nectar(
    nectar_df, model="gpt-4", response_column="gpt4_response"
)

# Sample a small subset from the dataset for the purpose of this tutorial
N_SUBSET = 30
dataset_df = nectar_gpt4_df.sample(N_SUBSET, random_state=42)
```

## 1.3 Data Labeling

We don't have human labels for scores, so we will use the [LLM-as-a-Judge approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685). GPT-4 will act as an evaluator, reviewing the query and Mixtral's response to provide a score from 1-5. As shown in the paper, the most robust way to get labels is by providing a reference answer for comparison. Here, GPT-4's own response serves as the reference, and Mixtral's response is evaluated against it.

There are two main steps in this process:
1. **Generate Mixtral-8x7B responses for all queries**: We will use an online batch-inference method utilizing Ray and Anyscale endpoints.
2. **Generate LLM-as-a-Judge labels**: We will ask GPT-4 to evaluate the Mixtral responses against its own reference answers and provide a score from 1 to 5.

### Generate Mixtral-8x7B Responses


```python
import yaml
from src.online_inference import generate_mixtral_responses

dataset_df = generate_mixtral_responses(
    dataset_df, os.getenv("ANYSCALE_API_KEY"), response_column="mixtral_response"

### Generate GPT-4-as-a-judge scores 

Let's first take a look at an example query we will send to GPT-4 for judgement


```python
from src.utils import inspect_llm_judge_queries

inspect_llm_judge_queries(dataset_df)
```

    [Instruction]
    Evaluate the AI assistant's proficiency in answering the user question displayed below. Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, adherence to real-world facts, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response. You will be given a reference answer which is considered of high quality. Your assessment will have two lines: First line has a rating on a scale of 1 to 5 with a higher rating representing higher response quality. Follow strictly this format: "[[rating]]", for example: "[[3]]". Second line contains a short explanation of your rating.
    
    [Question]
    Q: You are provided with an "Event", "Intent" related to PersonX. Guess a reaction/reaction of PersonX about the given event and their intention.
    Event:PersonX uses ___ in class. Intent: 1) to use his prefered writing implement
    A:
    
    [Reference Answer]
    PersonX might feel satisfied or content using their preferred writing implement in class, as it aligns with their intention to utilize a comfortable and desired tool for writing. 
    Confidence: 85%
    
    [Assistant Answer]
     PersonX likely feels comfortable and focused, as they are using their preferred writing implement in class. This may help them engage more effectively with the material being taught.
    
    Guidelines for Rating:
     - High Rating (4-5): Reserved for responses that are very close to the quality of the reference or even better.
     - Medium Rating (3): Reserved for responses that have moderate quality compared to the reference.
     - Low Rating (1-2): Allocated to response that are much lower quality compared to the reference or completely wrong.
    
    Assessment:
    


Now, we apply a similar online batch-inference method to generate our labels.


```python
import yaml
from src.online_inference import generate_llm_judge_labels

dataset_df = generate_llm_judge_labels(dataset_df, os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
```

Higher counts for 4-5 scores indicate that Mixtral-8x7B consistently produces high-quality responses, demonstrating its competitive performance compared to the June 2023 version of GPT-4, whose responses are logged in the Nectar dataset.

Let us assume that if the score is >= 4, we will route to the OSS model (indicating the response quality is good enough); otherwise, we will route to the closed model. Under this assumption, the data distribution looks like this:



```python
train_df["routing_label"] = train_df["mixtral_score"].apply(
    lambda x: 1 if x >= 4 else 0
)
visualize_label_distribution(train_df, key="routing_label")

# Step 2: Finetune a router model <a id="finetune-router-model"></a>

In this section, we will explain how to finetune an LLM as a router. While our data contains `gpt4_response` and `mixtral_response`, we will only use the pair (`query`, `mixtral_score`) for training. The goal is for the router to rely solely on the query text to determine which model to route to. Our approach is straightforward: we train a 5-way classifier to predict the `mixtral_score` from the `query`. At inference time, we will route to Mixtral if our router predicts a high score (i.e., 4-5) and to GPT-4 otherwise.


## 2.1 Data Preparation
We will discuss a few preprocessing steps to prepare the data for finetuning an LLM to be a router.

We use the instruction-following framework to finetune an LLM as a router. The task instructions guide the model to predict the score label for a given query. They ensure the model understands the evaluation criteria and can accurately assess the query's complexity and expected response quality.


```python
from src.utils import inspect_instructions

inspect_instructions()
```

    [Instruction]
    Based on the question provided below, predict the score an expert evaluator would give to an AI assistant's response, considering its helpfulness, relevance, adherence to facts, depth, creativity, and detail. Your prediction should infer the level of proficiency needed to address the question effectively. Use a scale from 1 to 5, where a higher score indicates a higher anticipated quality of response. Provide your prediction as: "[[predicted rating]]".
    
    Score criteria:
    - **4-5**: The AI assistant can produce a very strong answer, showing deep understanding, creativity, detailed insight, and high relevance.
    - **3**: The AI assistant can provide an adequate answer with moderate detail, relevance, and factual accuracy.
    - **1-2**: The AI assistant will struggle to produce a strong answer due to the question's difficulty, vagueness, or the assistant's limitations.
    
    [Question]
    {question}
    
    Prediction:
    


### API Data Format

To finetune the model, we must format the data to be compatible with [Anyscale's finetuning API](https://docs.anyscale.com/endpoints/fine-tuning/dataset-prep).



```python
from src.utils import prepare_ft_messages

train_df["messages"] = prepare_ft_messages(train_df, "mixtral_score")

# here's what the API data format looks like:
display(train_df["messages"].iloc[0])
```


    [{'role': 'system',
      'content': '[Instruction]\nBased on the question provided below, predict the score an expert evaluator would give to an AI assistant\'s response, considering its helpfulness, relevance, adherence to facts, depth, creativity, and detail.

     {'role': 'user',
      'content': "[Question]\nI'll give you a review, can you extract the food aspects and the opinion words of these aspects and analyze the sentiment of these opinion from this review? the review is:They tore the old NAME_1 down then built another one...?

I ordered some tacos and French toast sticks both were pretty good. I think I'd like to try more snacks.And they're open 24/7.\n\nPrediction:\n"},
     {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '[[4]]'}]


### Label Rebalancing

For classification tasks, it's recommended to train on label-balanced datasets to ensure models are not biased to a specific label. We will balance the dataset based on `routing_label`, as this is the label of primary interest.



```python
from src.utils import balance_dataset

balanced_train_df = balance_dataset(train_df, key="routing_label")
print(f"Train size: {len(balanced_train_df)}")
```

    Train size: 29504


### Subsample and Store Data

To expedite the time to run this tutorial, we will subsample 1,000 examples for training. We'll store the data in JSONL format to prepare for launching the finetuning job in the next section.


```python
n_sample = 1000
output_file = "/mnt/user_storage/train_data_sample.jsonl"

subsampled_df = balanced_train_df.sample(n=n_sample, random_state=42)
subsampled_df.to_json(output_file, orient="records", lines=True)
```

## 2.2 Fine-tune with Anyscale API

We will run a fine-tuning job using Anyscale's LLM finetuning API as an isolated job, similar to our [end-to-end LLM workflows guide](https://github.com/anyscale/e2e-llm-workflows?tab=readme-ov-file#fine-tuning-1).

For this tutorial, we will perform full-parameter finetuning of Llama3-8B on the same 1,000 samples we showed earlier to debug the training dynamics and ensure the model can fit the training set. Below, we present the training and job configurations before submitting the training job.



```python
# View the full-param finetuning configuration for llama-3-8B

          - "[[4]]"
          - "[[5]]"



```python
# View job yaml config
!cat configs/ft_job.yaml

    max_retries: 0



```python
# Job submission
!anyscale job submit --config-file configs/ft_job.yaml --exclude assets
```

    Output

The job takes around 10 minutes on `4xA100-80gb` and 1 hour on `8xA10-22gb` to finish. Training logs will show the final model checkpoint, e.g.:

```
Best checkpoint is stored in:

With perplexity: 1.0318867739521242
```
This checkpoint can be used to run batch inference or serve the model online.

# Step 3: Offline Evaluation <a id="offline-eval"></a>

Next, we will conduct an offline evaluation of the model trained on an out-of-domain dataset. The same model, now trained on the full dataset, is available in the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM/](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM/), along with other router models.


### Install `RouteLLM` package


```python
# Clone the repository under /home/ray/default/
!git clone https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM.git /home/ray/default/RouteLLM

# Change to the cloned repository directory
%cd /home/ray/default/RouteLLM

# Install the package with the specified extras
!pip install -e .[eval]
```
  ...
    Successfully installed routellm-0.0.1


### Running Evaluation
We will use the RouteLLM evaluation framework to measure the performance of our router against a random router on GSM8K. 
We report the percentage of calls the router needs to send to GPT-4 in order to achieve `20%`, `50%` and `80%` of GPT-4 performance, along with area under curve. 
See our paper for more details on the evalaution metrics.


```python
!python -m routellm.evals.evaluate --config config.example.yaml --routers random causal_llm --benchmark gsm8k
```

    Namespace(routers=['random', 'causal_llm'], benchmark='gsm8k', output='.', overwrite_cache=[], parallel=96, config='config.example.yaml', num_results=10)

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

# Display full plot saved in the following path
image_path = "/home/ray/default/RouteLLM/gsm8k.png"
display(Image(filename=image_path))
```

This plot illustrates that as we relax the cost constraints (i.e., increase the percentage of GPT-4 calls), the performance improves. While the performance of a random router improves linearly with cost, our router achieves significantly better results at each cost level.

# Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have successfully built and evaluated a finetuned-LLM router. We generated synthetic labeled data using the LLM-as-a-judge method to train the model, finetuned an LLM classifier using Anyscale's API, and conducted offline evaluation on a standard benchmark, demonstrating that our model is effective in out-of-domain generalization.
